My personal website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby framework for static sites and blogs. Jekyll adds a ton of new possibilities with the combination of page templates, Liquid, and Markdown.

### So, why Jekyll?

When I first decided I wanted to build my own personal website, I was faced with an overwhelming options for where to start and what toolkits to use. Services like WordPress and Squarespace offered comprehensive tools and templates for a monthly fee, but I wanted to get more hands-on with building the site structure. Popular choices such as [React.js](https://react.dev) were also promising, but there was still the need to find a way to host my site. Eventually I discovered Jekyll, which let me create a static site with the flexibility of Markdown and Liquid. 

All of my site could be neatly organized with Jekyll's structure, giving me plenty of flexibility to incorporate new features without increasingly complicated refactors.
