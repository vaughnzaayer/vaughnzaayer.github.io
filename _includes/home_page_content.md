## Hi, I'm Vaughn Zaayer. 
I'm currently a math major at Reed College graduating in May 2026. Most recently, I gave a talk on my thesis research, and completed courses in real analysis and cryptography. I specialize in both theoretical mathematics and practical applications in computer science.


Check out some of the [projects](/project_pages/active_projects.html) I've worked on through my coursework and hobbies. I'm also working on my [blog](/blog.html), so keep an eye out for new posts!


**I am seeking career opportunities in software engineering and related fields.**
